# PinoyJobsPH Scraper

This Python script extracts the job title, location, date posted, job description, and salary information for all job listings that are found at `https://pinoyjobs.ph/jobs/`.

The data collected from this scraper could be used for text analytics purposes, such as the topic modelling of jobs demanded by the industry. 

Likewise, machine learning techniques such as clustering analysis and recommender systems could be constructed in order to identify what are the jobs that are similar to each other.
